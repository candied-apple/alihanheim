## Usage

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Start the application locally with `npm start`.
3. Push your changes to GitHub and create a tag (e.g., `git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0`) to trigger the build workflow.
4. The GitHub Action will automatically build for all platforms and create a release with the binaries.
